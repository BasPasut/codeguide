##SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)


 The single responsibility principle means every class should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by the software, and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class. It will make your code clear and easy to read because instead of create all your methods in one class with a lot of purpose, 
we will break down into many class and each class will have only one purpose.
